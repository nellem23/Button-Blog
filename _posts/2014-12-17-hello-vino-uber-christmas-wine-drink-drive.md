Hello Vino is one of the world's most popular wine apps, with millions of users. They help users to find a great bottle every time & remember those that they loved.

Have a glass too many? Have Hello Vino get you a ride home & if you're a new user, they'll also hook you up with $30 of credit towards your ride!

Hello Vino is so exciting to us for a few reasons; not only are we users ourselves, but they were the first integration completed totally independently using our new Integration Docs (coming soon)! The Hello Vino team went away and came back with a beautiful, polished integration... it really looks great.

Stay safe this holiday season and book an Uber with Hello Vino. Join the conversation on Twitter with <a href="http://twitter.com/button" target="_blank">@button</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hellovino" target="_blank">@hellovino</a>.
