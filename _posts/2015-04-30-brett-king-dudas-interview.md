Last week, Brett King had our co-founder Mike Dudas on <a href="http://www.breakingbanks.com/" target="_blank">Breaking Banks</a>. Here's what he had to say..

<b>Brett</b>: Welcome to Breaking Banks this week. It’s great to have you with us. Up now is Mike Dudas. Mike, welcome back to Breaking Banks.

<b>Mike</b>: Thank you very much. I’m very excited to be here.

<b>Brett</b>: We’ve obviously talked before in your previous incarnation when you were doing some work with Braintree/Venmo, but now you’ve moved on to a brand-new start-up. Tell us about that.

<b>Mike</b>: Absolutely, a start-up company called Button based here in New York City with a number of fantastic folks from the mobile commerce, retail, loyalty and affiliate world. We were all viewing the mobile commerce market and trying to figure out where there are problems and opportunities for new companies to create value. Looking at the landscape, if you think about the entire funnel for a mobile commerce app, there are great solutions at the top of funnel — great advertising solutions, the Facebook ecosystem, the Google ecosystem. At the bottom of the funnel, there are fantastic solutions in terms of PayPal, Stripe and Braintree for processing and a number of mobile wallets, plus Apple Pay. So it’s really in the in the middle of that customer journey where we saw an opportunity to create value and that opportunity is connecting apps to one another, both to improve customer experience and to offer a new channel for customer acquisition.

<b>Brett</b>: Can you give us some examples?

<b>Mike</b>: A quick example of that would be connecting two apps that are very complementary to one another. When I go out to dinner for the evening and make a dinner reservation, it’s pretty clear that I need to get there or that I’m going to need to park my car when I arrive at the restaurant. Button has connected an app called Resy, which is a dinner reservation app here in New York City and a few other cities, with Uber such that I can set a reminder to call an Uber 30 minutes before my dinner. It allows me to get a push notification before dinner, quickly book the Uber with my information already passed through about my destination, so it’s super seamless. I can do the same thing if I want to park instead. We’re just connecting apps together that have complementary functionality. The business model here is that the app that’s receiving the incremental transaction, in this case Uber, will pay an affiliate fee to the app that sourced that traffic and basically created the intent for that service.

<b>Brett</b>: It sounds like to make this happen, you must have approached a number of app companies in advance.

<b>Mike</b>: Absolutely. What’s really worked is that open API’s have benefited us tremendously. What it allows us to do is bring multiple services to a large partner that historically hasn’t had commerce integrations.

<b>Brett</b>: Mike, you guys also announced in January a funding round. Tell us about that.

<b>Mike</b>: It has been super exciting for us. We raised a $12 million series A-round led by Chris Moore, who is a phenomenal investor with Redpoint Ventures, the Silicon Valley based firm. They are very complementary to our existing investors, with deep experience and expertise investing in the on-demand economy, in advertising technology and in great products. Andy Rubin just joined the firm as a partner, so they have phenomenal resources at Redpoint, and they’ve already been unbelievable partners and supporters. All our investors have. I can’t say enough how important the investors are who make introductions, who can recognize patterns in your business that they’ve seen before that are key to launching successful companies. Our investors have been a huge accelerant to our business. We’re really excited about it.

<b>Brett</b>: What have you raised in total to date?

<b>Mike</b>: We’ve raised $14.25 million dollars. We’re well funded, and we’re lean. It’s not like we’re out there with a crazy burn rate. We’re very disciplined in how we spend money, disciplined in how we hire and grow.

<b>Brett</b>: I’m not going to ask you what your burn rate is.

<b>Mike</b>: We’re very disciplined, but it gives us that comfort that if there is a downturn, we can weather it and if there’s not, we have the juice to accelerate growth.

<b>Brett</b>: Let’s talk about how you guys build partnerships, because I know you’ve got a lot of partners involved. You mentioned Uber before and Resy and others but how do you guys go about enlisting support of those organizations. You must have quite a team going out working on what we would traditionally call merchant acquiring or vendor partnerships. How do you go about that?

<b>Mike</b>: It’s very similar to how Braintree or Stripe would approach a merchant sales process. It’s very different actually than merchant acquiring in the offline world. You’re trying to appeal to both the marketing organization and say, “You know it’s going to be a great customer acquisition channel for you” as well as the technology and product organization to say, “Embedding this functionality in your app is going to improve your users’ experience, increase revenue and we’re going to do it in a way that is of the quality of your app, so it’s going to have the same features, the same stability and it’s going to be beautiful and it’s going to be something that you’re proud of.”

It’s very similar as well to how we sold Google Wallet where you had so many stakeholders across the organization from IT to marketing to operations to product. This is the model for how you sell a B2B technology product today. It needs to be both developer friendly as well as marketer and product friendly.

<b>Brett</b>: When are you guys actually launching?

<b>Mike</b>: We have launched already, and we have a number of Uber integrations in market, a half dozen of them in different apps including Tablelist andSquadUp and Hello Vino. That’s been very exciting, and we’re actually going to be launching in about three weeks, a significant partnership connecting Uber to a large local mobile app company. That’s really exciting for us, and we also now have the ability to connect to companies other than Uber. We recently signed a partnership with Handy. We have signed a few other really large partnerships that we haven’t announced yet, and we really are excited about the progress. We have product in market, and we’re going to have a lot more in market over the next couple of months.

<b>Brett</b>: The Uber partnership is a pretty significant one.

<b>Mike</b>: Of course! Any time you’re trying to build a two-sided network, you really do need a compelling anchor partner or value proposition that will get the other side of the market to take note. It’s really hard to build networks. You’ve seen the biggest ad networks or platforms of this era created via their own property as that anchor — Facebook has built a massive ads platform, primarily a mobile ads platform. Twitter has built a pretty large one. Google has built a very significant one, first on desktop then on mobile off owned assets. In our case, without an owned asset, there’s no better partner or anchor partner you have in the world than Uber, which is the largest startup or growth company in the last five years by a pretty good margin and a company with a daily use case that everybody wants to partner with and participate with.

It’s been a huge partnership for us, very exciting, and we have a couple others lined up that have that similar frequency in use case and scale that are going to be really compelling to the other side of the market. These are apps, whether it’s a messaging app, whether it’s an airline or travel app or content app like Condé Nast properties or New York Times who want to monetize in a different way than ads.

<b>Brett</b>: I want to change track a little bit here and get into a bit of a looking forward forecasting. Obviously with the Apple Watch that’s launching in days and a lot of interest in how that’s going to pan out and one of the interesting restrictions we saw with the Apple Watch is this ten second rule in terms of app usage, clearly showing that it’s designed more as a notification layer than an app engagement platform specifically. We’re starting to see a lot more thought. Google Glass helped start this with distinct notifications emerging as an entirely new way of engaging on top of the app infrastructure, starting to break apart messaging and notifications across multiple platforms. How do you think that’s going to affect the way these apps cooperate together and how this app ecosystem or mobile ecosystem generally evolves? Do you have any thoughts on that?

<b>Mike</b>: There’s no question that notifications are one of the most important ways that app developers can get engagement with their app, and you’ve seen a number of companies that are working specifically on notification technology. What we try to do is on top of that notification, layer in a call to action. In the Resy and Uber integration, it’s not just that we connect Resy with Uber. That would be hard to do because I book my dinner reservation a day in advance perhaps or two days in advance. How am I going to even remember to call that Uber thirty minutes before? What we do is we fire a local notification, which is a message that I see as the user and then from that, I engage back into the Resy app to call the Uber. If you don’t have those triggers or notifications (we’ve seen this across all the apps we have integrated with), it is very hard for the user of the apps to ferret out the functionality that you’re trying to provide and to get engagement. There’s no question that we’re moving to a notification-based world, probably a notification overload-based world, and so the next question is “how do we manage those?” How do we make it easier such that this doesn’t turn into a channel like the app store itself or my home screen that’s completely overloaded with too many messages to figure out what’s truly important.

<b>Brett</b>: Mike, let’s talk about where Button is going over the next few months and what your plans are.

<b>Mike</b>: Right now, we’re really focused on building the initial connection, ensuring that we can connect dozens of apps that have audiences with intent to purchase with dozens of apps where they can spend their money and get what they want or need. Once you get beyond that, you need to do more than just be an app connector. We think over time deep linking and the idea of connecting one app with another is going to become commoditized, so we’re always thinking about what is the next level of functionality we can offer on top of that connection. An obvious area to go given our deep experience is payments. Our two engineering leaders — one is from Google, a Wallet and Platform engineer, and one was the iOS lead at Venmo — so we have fantastic payments experience. I also have experience on the business side.

We are constantly thinking about how we can bring more value to these mobile commerce apps. One is to actually start to bring some shopping cart adjustment technology into play such that for example, airline, hotel or bank loyalty points can be burned very easily into these mobile commerce apps. That’s a question we’ve definitely gotten from a number of partners. Can you bring more than just credit card processing? Can you bring loyalty points into the equation? We’re constantly thinking about that.

<b>Brett</b>: Do you think the loyalty programs with points are going to survive? Fundamentally, I have had this discussion a few times. The key problem with loyalty programs and points is that it’s a delayed result. You have to wait to get the reward, and I think Millennials are much more focused on that instant gratification. I just don’t know whether that whole paradigm is going to survive real time context.

<b>Mike</b>: I think you’re absolutely right. In fact, you and I were talking about this on Twitter a little bit the other day. The rewards are becoming eye-bulging — Capital One offering 20% back on every Uber ride for the next year for certain cardholders. There’s a real wow factor, but what’s different is that these aren’t card-linked offers that you can only redeem at a specific merchant a week from now when you are going to forget you even have the offer. I think you’re going to see a movement towards earning points and then being able to really easily and instantaneously see that points balance and spend it accordingly at a merchant.

<b>Brett</b>: Think of it as currency.

<b>Mike</b>: Exactly.

<b>Brett</b>: I buy this.

<b>Mike</b>: We talk about a currency that’s in this mobile commerce realm, sort of a federated loyalty currency and that’s definitely something that we think about constantly at Button.

<b>Brett</b>: Listen, where can people find out more information about Button?

<b>Mike</b>: <a href="www.usebutton.com">usebutton.com</a> or my Twitter feed @mdudas. I definitely tweet a lot about Button! And <a href="http://twitter.com/button">@button</a> is our Twitter handle.
