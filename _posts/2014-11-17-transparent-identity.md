It’s a big week for both our design team and everyone at Button. For the past month we’ve been hard at work designing a brand that represents what Button stands for and we’re excited to share that with you today.

### History
When starting a company, the identity isn’t (and shouldn’t) be the focus, but we always intended to give Button’s brand the attention it deserved. Our first logo was a simple typeface and understated mark.

Our technology will extend a user’s experience within an app with products like DeepLink Commerce and Loyalty. We help people discover their next favorite app, exposing them to products and services they would have never found otherwise. It’s a great feeling that we felt an obligation to capture visually.

### Process
The design team began it’s exploration by engaging each team member to find what they felt defined Button now and going forward. We heard words like “convenience” and “delight”. The various interviews began to help us make hard decisions and provided clarity about who we wanted to be. For many of our teammates, it was the first time their thoughts would directly impact a company’s brand…exciting to say the least.

Using various inspiration boards, we gauged the team’s response to messaging, color, typography, and iconography. We earned the trust of the team and aligned through these meetings and workshops.

### Creative
Our new logo is clean, modern, and strong. It’s more confident than the original, an attribute only made possible by our focus and refined vision. Paired with a polished new mark, it’s timeless not trendy. The typeset is a revitalized sans serif Indian face, Kannada Sangam MN in Bold. The logo is asymmetrical in form because the mark is slightly taller than the capline of the “B” in Button. The stroke of the mark and the parallel spacing between letters and the mark constructs the illusion of symmetry and balance.

After the logo, we continued to work towards designing an experience that retained our identity while living in other apps and digital products. Our team explored several concepts and landed on a combination of blur, to give the illusion of depth, and cards, to help users distinguish our content from the originating app.

We also set out to design patterns for four use-cases: cleaning, delivery, transportation, and travel/fun/entertainment. These will be used in a variety of different products and as marketing collateral. As Button and the on-demand economy continue to grow, our design team will create corresponding visuals that allow us to have a distinct voice in other apps.

Our goal from the very beginning of this process was to created a brand that keeps its identity while living inside of our partners’ apps and other digital products. All great brands adapt. As Button matures, launches new products, forms new partnerships, and grows, so will the brand we’ve created.
